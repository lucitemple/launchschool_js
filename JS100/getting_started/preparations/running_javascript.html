<!-- Running JavaScript in the Browser
1. Create an HTML file with some HTML content. 
2. Add a script tag to the HTML file that has the path to your .js file in the src attribute
3. Save the HTML file, then open it in a browser. You should see a blank page in your browser. To see the JavaScript output, you must visit the console. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./example.js"></script>
    <!--     Another way to run JavaScript in the browser is to write all your JavaScript between the opening and closing <script> tags: don't use a .js file at all: -->
    <script>
      console.log("Hello, world!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
