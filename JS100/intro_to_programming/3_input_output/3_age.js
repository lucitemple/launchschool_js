// 3. Modify the age.js program you wrote in the exercises for the Variables chapter. The updated code should ask the user to enter their age instead of hard-coding the age in the program. Here's an example run:

let rlSync = require("readline-sync");

function futureAge() {
  let age = Number(rlSync.question("How old are you?\n"));
  console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 20 years, you will be ${age + 20} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 30 years, you will be ${age + 30} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 40 years, you will be ${age + 40} years old.`);
}

futureAge();
