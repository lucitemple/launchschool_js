1. Function that returns the sum of two numbers

INFORMAL Pseudocode

Given two numbers as arguments.

Set a variable value equal to the first number added to the second number.

Return the saved value.

FORMAL Pseudocode

START

# Given two numbers as arguments.

SET savedNumber = number1 + number2

PRINT savedNumber

END

2. Function that takes an array of strings and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

INFORMAL Pseudocode

Given a collection of strings.

Iterate through the collection one by one.

- initialise a string value
- for each iteration, add/concatenate/reduce the element to the string value.

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.

FORMAl Pseudocode

START

# Given a collection of strings called "strings"

SET iterator = 0;
SET savedString = '';

WHILE iterator <= length of strings
SET currentString = value within strings collection at space "iterator"

    SET savedString to value of savedString + currentString

    iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT savedString

END


3. A function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

INFORMAL Pseudocode

Given a collection of integers.

Set an empty array.

Iterate through the collection of integers by every second element.

- set the iterator to += 2
- for each iteration, add the current element to the array.

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value from the array.

FORMAL Pseudocode

START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers".

SET savedArray = empty array
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
SET currentNumber = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"

    push currentNumber to savedArray
    iterator = iterator + 2

PRINT savedArray

END
